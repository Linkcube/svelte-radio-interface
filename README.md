# svelte-radio-interface
A svelte version of the existing [nai](https://github.com/Linkcube/nai) repo

## Usage

```

## Features
- Control Nora recording with a gui
- View/play past recordings
- Dashboard of the current DJ, current song, and server data

## Differences
- More compact layout
- Done without component libraries, so it may look a bit duller

- It's in svelte!

## Todo
- Snackbar or equivelent for clicking the control buttons
- Possibly more component styling changes
