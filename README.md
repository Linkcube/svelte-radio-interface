# svelte-radio-interface
A svelte version of the existing [nai](https://github.com/Linkcube/nai) repo

## Usage
No builds yet, so just run the following for now if you really want to test it out. Also make sure to have [Nora](https://github.com/Linkcube/nora) running.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Differences
- More compact layout
- Done without component libraries, so it may look a bit duller
- No UI update from stopping/starting stream
- Cannot edit server settings (for now)
- Cannot display past recordings (for now)
- It's in svelte!

## Todo
- Edit server settings
- Display past recordings (in a new way)
- Snackbar or equivelent for clicking the control buttons
- Possibly more component styling changes
